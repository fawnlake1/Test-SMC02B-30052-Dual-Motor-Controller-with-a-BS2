## Description

Code to test SMC02B / 30052 Dual Motor Controller with a BS2

After pulling my hair out and spending fruitless hours searching the web for a good example of how to use the Parallax #30052 / SMC02B Pololu controller I gave up and created my own.

The attached file will quickly test a pair of DC motors connected to a Stamp and also (I hope) explain the commands and operation of the motor controller as I understand them.

Maybe it will help someone down the road.

Have fun,
Jeff
